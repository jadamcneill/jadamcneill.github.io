  <li>Artist: Machine Gun Kelly </li>

  <li>Album: General Admission</li>

  <li>Year Released: 2015</li>

  <li>Instruments: Guitar, Bass, Drums, Percussion, Synthesizers</li>

<li>Fun Fact: Round here is the only self written song on this album</li>

<p>This album is the evolution of MGK. There is extreme growth between General Admission and Lace Up. Besides the obvious voice change, this has a more cohesive theme to it. Colson tackles subjects in his life that he has never touched on, such as his mother, the real struggles of Cleveland, and the amount of love he has for his daughter. This album has extreme potential and shows so much growth from his debut.</p>
