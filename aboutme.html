<h1 style=“font-size:60px;”>About Jada’s Reviews</h1>



<p>My name is Jada Mcneill. I was born and raised in New York City. Ever since I was little, I have always loved music. I remember watching music award shows ever since I was a little girl. As I got older, I realized there was different aspects of music that a person could pursue. I remember listening to all my favorite albums and focusing on the instrumentation and production of the albums. I remember focusing on the cover art of the albums, and focusing on the craft that the artist or band takes to make their album theirs. I started reviewing albums at age 16, and have not stopped since. Our social media page is: @JadasReviews, and my personal account is @jadamcneill (on all platforms)</p>
